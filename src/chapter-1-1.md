Critical thinking involves the ability to objectively analyze and evaluate information, ideas, and arguments. It is a process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to guide decision-making and problem-solving.

They approach challenges with open-mindedness, intellectual curiosity, and logical reasoning.
